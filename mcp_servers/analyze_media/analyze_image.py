# `analyze_image`

Call a multimodal LLM API to analyze and understand image files ONLY. This tool ONLY accepts image files (PNG/JPG/JPEG/GIF/WEBP). For any non-image files(text files, code files, etc.), use read tool instead.

Use cases:
- OCR: Extract and recognize text that appears WITHIN images (e.g., screenshots, photos of documents, diagrams with labels)
- Image Inspection: Detect quality issues, defects, or visual problems
- Image Recognition: Identify and describe objects, people, scenes, UI elements in images
- Image Comparison: Analyze visual similarity or differences between images

- DO NOT read text files or other non-image files using this tool. Use read tool instead.
