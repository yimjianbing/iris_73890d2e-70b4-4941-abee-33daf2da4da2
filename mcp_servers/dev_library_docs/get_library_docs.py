# `get_library_docs`

Fetches up-to-date documentation for a library. You must call 'resolve_library_id' first to obtain the exact library ID required to use this tool, .

USAGE GUIDELINES:
- This tool works for BOTH internal libraries (from code.byted.org like "code.byted.org/middleware/hertz/byted") AND public libraries (from github.com, golang.org, etc). 
- You Must use this tool for any libraries you're not familiar with. DO NOT guess or assume how a library works based on similar libraries or general knowledge.
- Always get multiple library docs in parallel when possible. Aim for combined coverage code snippets ≥ 40 when possible.
- If an '@docs/' variant exists for a target, search the '@docs/' library first as higher priority.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION (KEEP IT SIMPLE AND EXPLICIT):
- Preferred format: <LanguageToken> <key intent terms> (e.g., Go HTTP routing, Java JWT middleware).
- Focus on core nouns/verbs from the user intent; avoid noise terms.
- Include specific framework or feature keywords if present in the selected libraries.
- If the LanguageToken is uncertain, try to infer from context (code snippet, file extension, keywords).

WORKFLOW:
1. Resolve library candidates
  - resolve_library_id(library_name=<user_query>, top_n=<k>)
2. Choose libraries
  - include all relevant libraries.
3. Build search query
  - Apply the QUERY CONSTRUCTION rules.
  - Use the preferred format: "<LanguageToken> <key intent terms>"
4. Fetch docs in parallel
  - get_library_docs(library_id=<library_id>, topic=<constructed_query>)
