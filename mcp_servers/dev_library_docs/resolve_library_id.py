# `resolve_library_id`

Resolves library IDs by searching the knowledge base for libraries matching the given name. Returns a list of matching libraries with their IDs, descriptions, and metadata.

USAGE GUIDELINES:
- You MUST call this function before get_library_docs to obtain a valid library ID.
- This tool works for BOTH internal libraries (from code.byted.org like "code.byted.org/middleware/hertz/byted") AND public libraries (from github.com, golang.org, etc). 
- You Must use this tool for any libraries you're not familiar with. DO NOT guess or assume how a library works based on similar libraries or general knowledge
	
QUERY CONSTRUCTION:
- Preferred format: <LanguageToken> <canonical library or ecosystem term>
- Examples: Go Gin, Go GORM, Java Spring, TypeScript WebSocket, Python FastAPI
- If the user gives only a feature, add an ecosystem/framework anchor:
  	Good: Go router gin, Java JWT spring
- Include common aliases/abbreviations (e.g., Gin, GORM, Spring, Kafka) and keep it short (2-5 words)
- If the LanguageToken is uncertain, infer from context (code snippet, file extension, keywords) or omit it and rely on feature + ecosystem.
