A versioned schema allows you to answer not only \"What is the data now?\" but also \"What was the data at a specific point in time?\" and \"How has this data changed?\"\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive guide to designing and implementing versioning patterns in relational databases (RDBMS). It is intended for engineers and architects who need to build robust, auditable, and maintainable systems.\n\n### Core Concepts\n- **Immutability**: The core principle of versioning is that data is never truly deleted or overwritten. Instead, changes create new versions, preserving the old ones as historical records.\n\n- **Temporality**: This refers to the time-based nature of data. We often distinguish between:\n\t- **Valid Time**: The time period during which a fact is ","document_id":"","tool_name":""}
